## About Us
We are a startup automating enterprise robots through ML and LLMs. Our mission is to use LLMs and Function Calling to APIs and other comms systems to automate and enhance the capabilities of enterprise robots. By pushing the boundaries of natural language processing and seamless integration with existing systems, we aim to redefine the role of robots in streamlining business processes and improving efficiency.

## Our Structure
Our codebase follows a monorepo structure internally. Certain aspects of the work we do will be open-sourced as time goes on.
